                <h4>A box of Kleenex is your friend!</h4>
                <p> Do not worry if you feel like "you don't get it" it is natural especially, if you come from a non tech background. I had anxiety, frustration, anger, and yes cryed at each lessons.</p>

                <p> Even, if you grab that box of Kleenex do not give up. Just walk away for a minute or maybe a couple of days but don't forget to get back to it.</p>

                <h4>Imposter Syndrome.</h4>
                <p>When you are learning a new skill it can be challenging. And when it is a career change your confidence will be tested and some days the feeling of Imposter Syndrome will take over. In that instance take a break and remember why you started this journey!  </p>

                <p>Learning tech is fun. It allows you to be creative and analytical at the same time. I say enjoy the process and always look forward to learning a new skill that will give you abunace of opprotunties to be innovated and forward thinking.</p>

                <p> Have fun :) </p>
